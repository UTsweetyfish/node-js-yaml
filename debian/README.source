As the browserified version of js-yaml is not guarantied to work,
and cannot be build from source in Debian due to Browserify not
yet being packaged for Debian, the dist/ directory has been excluded
from the tarball.

Files Excluded: is used in debian/copyright, so a standard uscan
should be enough to obtain and repack the tarball for the next
upstream release.
