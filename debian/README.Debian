Browserify is required to build the browser version of js-yaml. This has not
yet been packaged for Debian.

In addition, the upstream README.md states that the browser version was only
produced for their demo, is not guaranteed to work, and not supported.
Therefore, only the node-module version of js-yaml is included in this
Debian package.
